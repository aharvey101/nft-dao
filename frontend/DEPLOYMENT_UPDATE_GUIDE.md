// This is what you'll need to update in constants.js after deployment

// OLD ADDRESSES (current):
export const CryptoDevsNFTAddress = "0x32493025887bF2Cfdf9ADe65EF9586452b8D6827";
export const FakeNFTMarketplaceAddress = "0xef4d500A8077df91B982a2CE1bdb3964F534e888";
export const CryptoDevsDAOAddress = "0x08bA63A89e89ad5082F0511902c2d490a6660fe7";

// NEW ADDRESSES (after deployment - you'll get these from the deployment output):
// export const CryptoDevsNFTAddress = "0x[NEW_NFT_ADDRESS]";
// export const FakeNFTMarketplaceAddress = "0x[NEW_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS]";
// export const CryptoDevsDAOAddress = "0x[NEW_DAO_ADDRESS]";

// The ABIs will stay the same since the interface is the same
// But the DAO ABI might need a small update for the new hasVoted function
